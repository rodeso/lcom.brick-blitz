## Project Description

Our Project is based on the old Breakout game. The game has the user control a paddle using the keyboard keys, to bounce off a ball, that is supposed to hit bricks placed in the screen. When those bricks are hit they get destroyed. The goal is to destroy all bricks. After a certain amount of time, the bricks that have not been destroyed start approaching the paddle. The game ends when the user fails to hit the ball with the paddle 3 times, thus running out of the 3 lives, or the bricks reach the paddle level.
The game uses the timer to count down the time to get the bricks coming down, the keyboard to control the paddle and the video card to display the game
